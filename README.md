# Chip
Chippenham Folk festival Website

This is the master data for the website, no data is loaded here (ever)

Needs php 8

Installation:

Needs to be at a webspace root, Php needs the Document root in the php include path.

Needs ImageMagick installed for some features to work.

Then run int/Initialise.php - this will create appropriate subdirectories and populate the database with appropriate initial tables and values (Warning probably out of date).

It will (soon?) track changes to the structure of the database and automatically update as appropriate.

See int/AdminGuide.php for a lot more about the system admin

Does not include the data from the database, and most uploaded images under /images
