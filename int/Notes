Why I dropped:

I had done nothing in three sessions, but one roll of dice for something that was not even used.

I have no empathy with either the setting or the totally unrealistic characters.

I was very sceptical that this would be for me when we started, but was persuded to give it a go.  I am happy with Fantasy or real world / hard science, Scion is in the uncomfortable spot.
