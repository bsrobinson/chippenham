Hi,

I'm  a long standing TrueCall user.  (10+ years - model TC3 sn 010180405434)

Last week my phone was downgraded from a normal line to VOIP from the back of my broadband hub modem (the hub had just been upgraded).

I can make outgoing calls, and the TrueCall picks up incoming calls but my phone does not ring - so all calls are simply being registered.  If I unplug TrueCall and wire my DECT base station directly to the hub, the phones work.

I have reported this problem to EE and had long discussions with them, they suggested I contact you as well - they are doing tests and looking at the problem from their side.  I think the ring current may be too low for the phones to register (but could be wrong)
